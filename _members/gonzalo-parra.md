R. Gonzalo Parra is a Ramon y Cajal researcher within the Life Sciences department at BSC (June 2025).

Gonzalo graduated in 2010 from the Licenciatura in Bioinformatics in Oro Verde, Argentina at the Entre Rios National University. He obtained his PhD from Buenos Aires University in 2016 under Prof. Diego Ferreiro's supervision. He obtained a EMBO long-term postdoctoral fellowhip and joined the group of Dr. Johannes Soeding at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in Goettingen Germany (2016-2018). After, he joined the group of Prof. Oliver Stegle at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) in Heidelberg, Germany (2018-2021).

His research is focused on the development of computational tools to answer biological questions within different subfields in bioinformatics. He mainly focuses in Structural Bioinformatics and Single Cell Multiomics data. 

In addition to his research, Gonzalo has been involved in different organizations that promote bioinformatics at the international level mainly in the context of the International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB). In 2012, Gonzalo co-founded the ISCB Regional Student Group (RSG) Argentina and became one of the ISCB Student Council leaders until his retirement in 2025. Currently, he serves as a director at the ISCB Board of Directors. At the BSC Gonzalo collaborates with the Bioinfo4Women initiative. Since 2023, Gonzalo is one of the co-chairs in charge of the 3DSig Community of Specific Interest (COSI) from the In ternational Society for Computational Biology (ISCB).

Gonzalo is always interested to sponsor young researchers to join his team at BSC by applying to PhD and postdoctoral fellowships. New sources of funding get available from time to time and positions to join his team are advertised. If you are interested to join Gonzalo's group contact him directly.
