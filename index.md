The Evolutionary Systems Biophysics Lab was created in 2025, when [Gonzalo Parra](https://combine-lab.github.io/members/gonzalo-parra.html) started as a Ramon y Cajal researcher at the [Life Sciences Department at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center] (https://www.bsc.es/discover-bsc/organisation/scientific-structure/life-sciences).

We investigate how biological function emerges from physical constraints and evolutionary pressures, across multiple scales, from proteins to regulatory networks. The group combines principles from statistical physics, systems biology, and computational modeling to explore how different abstractions of network dynamics shape biological complexity and adaptability.

Our work spans molecular to systems level phenomena: analyzing how energetic landscapes influence protein function and evolution, and extending these concepts to gene regulatory networks and other biological systems. By studying how different constraints and features of the system are conserved or co-opted through evolution, the group aims to uncover general principles that govern the organization, robustness, evolvability and designability of life.

### Research Interests

Some of our main areas of interest include:

  * Maintenance and development of tools to localise and quantify local energetic frustration
    * [Frustratometer](http://frustratometer.qb.fcen.uba.ar/)
    * [FrustraEvo](https://frustraevo.bsc.es/)
      
  * Understanding the biophyical building principles of protein folds and protein function at the scale of the protein universe
    
  * Interpret generative machine learning methods through the lens of biophysics

  * Biophysical modelling of gene regulatory networks
